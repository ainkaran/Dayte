    <string name="bioString">Carl Gauss has been called &quot;The greatest mathematican since Antiquity.&quot; He was a German mathematician who contributed significantly to many fields, including number theory, algebra, statistics, analysis, differential geometry, geodesy, geophysics, electrostatics, astronomy, matrix theory, and optics.

Gauss had a remarkable influence in many fields of mathematics and science and is ranked as one of history\'s most influential mathematicians.&quot;\n\nThere are several stories of his early genius.

According to one, his gifts became very apparent at the age of three when he corrected, mentally and without fault in his calculations, an error his father had made on paper while calculating finances.

Another story has it that in primary school after the young Gauss misbehaved, his teacher, J.G. Büttner, gave him a task: add a list of integers in arithmetic progression; as the story is most often told, these were the numbers from 1 to 100. The young Gauss reputedly produced the correct answer within seconds, to the astonishment of his teacher and his assistant Martin Bartels.

Gauss\'s presumed method was to realize that pairwise addition of terms from opposite ends of the list yielded identical intermediate sums: 1 + 100 = 101, 2 + 99 = 101, 3 + 98 = 101, and so on, for a total sum of 50 × 101 = 5050. However, the details of the story are at best uncertain; some authors, such as Joseph Rotman in his book &quot; A first course in Abstract Algebra&quot;, question whether it ever happened.

According to Isaac Asimov, Gauss was once interrupted in the middle of a problem and told that his wife was dying. He is purported to have said, &quot;Tell her to wait a moment till I\'m done.&quot; This anecdote is briefly discussed in G. Waldo Dunnington\'s Gauss, Titan of Science where it is suggested that it is an apocryphal story.

He referred to mathematics as &quot;the queen of sciences&quot; and supposedly once espoused a belief in the necessity of immediately understanding Euler\'s identity as a benchmark pursuant to becoming a first-class mathematician.\"\n\n<i>- wikipedia.org, 2015</i>
